Lifelike is an open-source project that aims to provide a simple, yet powerful platform for turning structured and unstructured data from a variety of sources into a single, coherent and explorable knowledge graph.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started and run a fully functional development environment of Lifelike is to clone this repository and run the `make up` command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SBRG/lifelike.git
cd lifelike

make up
```

This will take a few minutes to complete, after which you can start using Lifelike by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You can log in using the default admin user `admin@example.com` and password `password`.

## Other installation methods

You can see more details about how to deploy lifelike in a production environment,
or customize the development installation in the following sections.

1. [Docker with Docker Compose](docker)
2. [Kubernetes with Helm chart](helm/lifelike)

## Lifelike main concepts

### Projects

Lifelike organizes content into projects. A project is a filesystem-like collection of resources either uploaded by users or generated by Lifelike based on other resources. Those resources can be all kinds of data, including structured data like spreadsheets, unstructured data like PDF files, images, or text documents.

### Knowledge Domains

Lifelike structures knowledge around domains. A domain is a collection of semantically related entities belonging to a field of study.

### Annotations

Annotations are a powerful way to attach context to your data in knowledge Domains, Lifelike automatically annotates all your data with Domain known entities as well as lets you define your own custom annotations.

### Knowledge Graph

Domain data sources are annotated and stored in a graph database. A knowledge graph consists of nodes and edges. Nodes are domain entities and edges are relations between entities.

### Visualizations

Visualizations are a powerful way to help you to understand the relationships between entities as well as a powerful tool to find new relationships as new data comes in.

Lifelike currently provides the following built-in visualization types:

- Maps
- Enrichment tables
- Sankey diagrams
- Pathway Browser

### Other features

- Multi-user collaborative workbench
- Powerful search engine
