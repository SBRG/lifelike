    Please be patient while Lifelike is being deployed ⏳


   🚀  To watch the resources being ready, run:

           kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods --watch


   🌐  To access Lifelike once it's ready:
          {{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}

          Navigate to http://{{ .Values.ingress.hostname }}
          {{- else }}

          1. Forward frontend service port to your local machine:

              kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} port-forward svc/{{ include "lifelike.fullname" . }}-frontend 8080:{{ .Values.frontend.service.port }}

          2. Then access Lifelike in a browser:

              http://localhost:8080

          You may also consider enabling ingress with `ingress.enabled=true`
          {{- end }}
