STRING is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and 
indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, 
and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases.

In Lifelike, we loaded only STRING annotation data for a few organisms (E. coli, Human, Yeast and Psuedomonas) for gene annoation
enrichment. The version in Lifelike was v11.0.  Currently version in string-db.org is v11.5. 

In Lifelike, db_STRING proteins are linked to genes through 'HAS_GENE' link.
